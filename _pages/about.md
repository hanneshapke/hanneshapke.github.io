I'm a product-focused **ML Engineering Leader** and **bestselling author** who specializes in building production machine learning systems that scale. As the first ML engineer at Digits, I established the technical foundation for machine learning initiatives ranging from similarity learning to custom generative AI solutions, working alongside an exceptional team of engineers and designers.

## Core Expertise

My work centers on solving complex challenges in production machine learning:

- **Production ML Architecture** - Designing scalable systems that bridge research and deployment
- **MLOps & Continuous Training** - Building robust pipelines for model lifecycle management
- **Generative AI Systems** - Implementing custom LLM solutions and deployment strategies
- **Similarity Learning** - Developing sophisticated matching engines

## Published Works

I've co-authored **four machine learning books** published by O'Reilly Media and Manning Publications:

**[GenAI Design Patterns](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/generative-ai-design/9798341622654)** (O'Reilly, 2025)
*A comprehensive guide to designing and deploying GenAI applications, with special focus on best practices and patterns.*

**[Machine Learning Production Systems](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/machine-learning-production/9781492092673/)** (O'Reilly, 2024)
*A comprehensive guide to engineering ML systems for production environments, with special focus on GenAI deployment patterns.*

**[Building Machine Learning Pipelines](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/building-machine-learning/9781492052897/)** (O'Reilly, 2020)
*The definitive resource for TensorFlow Extended (TFX) and end-to-end ML pipeline engineering.*

**[NLP in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/nlp-in-action)** (Manning, 2019)
*Practical guide to natural language processing, from statistical methods to deep learning approaches.*

These publications represent my commitment to advancing the field and helping practitioners build effective ML systems.

## Industry Leadership

**Google Developer Advisory Board (gDAB)**
I advise Google on strategic AI/ML initiatives and provide technical guidance on developer experience and tooling.

**TensorFlow Extended (TFX) Community Lead**
As a moderator of Google's TFX Special Interest Group, I help shape the future of production ML tooling and foster community collaboration.

**Open Source Contributor**
Active contributor to Google's Model Card Toolkit and other ML infrastructure projects that help teams document and understand their models.

## Professional Philosophy

I believe that **machine learning's true value emerges when research transitions successfully to production**. My approach focuses on building systems that are not only technically sophisticated but also operationally robust, maintainable, and aligned with business objectives.

Through my work at Digits, publications, and community involvement, I continuously explore innovative approaches to ML engineering challenges while maintaining practical focus on real-world deployment requirements.
