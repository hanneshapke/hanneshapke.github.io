Hi, I am Hannes, an **experienced, product-focused machine learning engineer** and **author** with a passion for building machine learning (ML) models and improving ML pipelines. I was Digits' first ML engineer and laid the ground work for a number of machine projects ranging from similarity machine learning to custom generative AI. Very excited to work with such an amazing team of colleagues. In my work, I focus on several key areas, including **similarity learning, machine learning for search, MLOps, and continuous model training**.

In addition to my work at Digits, I am also a co-author of two machine learning related books: **Building Machine Learning Pipelines (O'Reilly Media)** and **NLP in Action (Manning Publishing)**. Both of these works showcase Hannes' expertise in the field and his dedication to helping others understand and use machine learning effectively.

In addition to my professional accomplishments, I moderate Google's TensorFlow Extended (TFX) special interest group. As a **community leader of the TensorFlow Extended (TFX) group**, I am always looking for ways to connect with other professionals in the field. I am also an active contributor to Google's Model Card Toolkit project, which aims to help researchers and developers understand and document the characteristics of their ML models.

I am **passionate about using machine learning to solve real-world problems**, and dedicated my career to building and implementing effective machine learning solutions for a variety of industries. I am constantly seeking new ways to push the boundaries of what is possible with machine learning, and I am always looking for ways to improve and optimize the machine learning systems.
