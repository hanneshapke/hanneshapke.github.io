Hi, I am Hannes, an **experienced, product-focused machine learning engineer** and **author** with a passion for building machine learning (ML) models and improving ML pipelines. As Digits' first ML engineer, I established the foundation for numerous machine learning projects ranging from similarity learning to custom generative AI. I'm thrilled to work with such an exceptional team of colleagues.

## Areas of Expertise
My work focuses on several key areas:

- Similarity learning
- Machine learning for search
- MLOps
- Continuous model training

## Publications
In addition to my work at Digits, I've co-authored three machine learning related books:

- [Machine Learning Production Systems](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/machine-learning-production/9781492092673/) (O'Reilly Media)
- [Building Machine Learning Pipelines](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/building-machine-learning/9781492052897/) (O'Reilly Media)
- [NLP in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/nlp-in-action) (Manning Publishing)

These publications demonstrate my expertise in the field and my commitment to helping others understand and use machine learning effectively.

## Professional Engagement
I serve on **Google's Developer Board (gDAB)** where I advise Google on future projects in the AI/ML space.
I moderate **Google's TensorFlow Extended (TFX)** special interest group. As a **community leader** of the TensorFlow Extended (TFX) group, I continuously seek ways to connect with other professionals in the field.
I'm also an active contributor to **Google's Model Card Toolkit project**, which helps researchers and developers understand and document the characteristics of their ML models.

## Professional Philosophy
I am **passionate about using machine learning to solve real-world problems** and have dedicated my career to building and implementing effective machine learning solutions across various industries. I constantly seek new ways to push the boundaries of what's possible with machine learning and am always looking to improve and optimize machine learning systems.
